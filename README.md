### arch-install

## Welcome!

This is an Arch installation script made by CalvinKev, forked by fr000gs and then forked by me, to add a few options back like enabling multilib, and extra ones, such as AMD microcode option and a few optional programs. It will install kde, firefox, discord, steam and libreoffice(fresh) and optionally nvidia drivers, VS Code, Calibre, Krita, Lutris, etc.
